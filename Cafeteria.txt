A cafeteria table has N seats numbered from 1 to N from left to right. 
Social distancing guidelines require that every diner be seated such that K seats to their left and K seats to their right 
(or all the remaining seats to that side if there are fewer than K) remain empty.
There are M diners already seated at the table, the ith of whom is in seat Si. 
No two diners are sitting in the same seat, and the social distancing guidelines are satisfied.
Determine the maximum number of additional diners who can potentially sit at the table without violating the social distancing guidelines 
for any new or existing diners. Assume that the existing diners cannot move and that the additional diners will cooperate to maximize how many of them can sit down.

Please make sure to write a solution that runs within the given time limit.

Constraints
1≤N≤10^15
1≤K≤N
1≤M≤500,000 
M≤N
0≤Si≤N

Sample test case #1
N=10
K=1
M=2
S=[2, 6]
Expected Return Value = 3

Sample test case #2:

N=15, K=2, M=3, S=[11,6,14]

Expected Return Value = 1

Sample Explanation:

In this case, the cafeteria table has N=15 seats, with three diners currently at seats 11, 6, and 14 respectively, 
with social distancing guidelines of K=2. The table initially looks as follows, 
with brackets covering the K=2 seats to the left and right of each existing diner that may not be taken.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  [   ]   [   ]
Three additional diners may sit at seats 4, 8, and 10 without violating the social distancing guidelines.
In the second case, only 1 additional diner is able to join the table, by sitting in any of the first 3 seats.
